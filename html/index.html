    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p id="defineProblem">
        It can be difficult to divide people into groups. Whether it is 
        for a work or a school project, the employees or students must 
        sometimes be split into different groups to solve a problem. <br><br>
        Very often dividing people into groups are usually made randomly 
        without considering the different life situations people are in
        or what kind of personal attributes they have. <br><br>
        This program will allow you to input certain data for each person 
        which will be saved and stored. Afterwards you have the option to
        create groups based on a certain personal attribute and input how 
        many people should be placed in each group. <br><br>
        Teachers or project leaders who have to divide their students or 
        employees into groups are this programs primary user target.
        However this program works for any users who have the need to 
        divide people into groups and wish for a more structured way to 
        create the project groups.<br><br>
        You can read more about how this program works, how it was 
        created and how it could be furthered improved  by clicking the 
        below README.md button.
