    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p id="defineProblem">
        It can be difficult to divide people into groups. Whether it is 
        for a work or a school project, the employees or students must 
        sometimes be split into different groups to solve a problem. <br><br>
        Very often dividing people into groups are usually made randomly 
        without considering the different life situations people are in
        or what kind of personal attributes they have. <br><br>
        This site will allow you to input certain data for each person 
        which will be saved and stored. Afterwards you have the option to
        create groups based on a certain personal attribute and input how 
        many people should be placed in each group. <br><br>
        You can read more about how this program works, how it was 
        created and how it could be furthered improved  by clicking the 
        below README.md button.
